# Opt_CutTheRoots
TCO Marathon 2016 Round 1 

You want your line to be far from many points at once.

for that this you make to define groups.

first try with orthogonal only with length only.

need to know groups.

after that we bring together look same id.

update roots.

1) you get two points
2) you try to make a line -> perpendicular
3) you count how many were divided
4) you compute how much length is dead

ok, you have your points ... find ten nearest points

try to move some rotate gradus a little in different directions.
